The general problem in this scenario is to translate source code that is currently in use into corresponding source code that shall run on a new system. Up to now, this problem was addressed based on manually written converters, parser generators, compiler-compilers or meta-programming environments using term rewriting or similar techniques (see e. g.

Abstract = {Adhesive high-level replacement (HLR) categories and systems are introduced as a new categorical framework for graph transformation in a broad sense, which combines the well-known concept of HLR systems with the new concept of adhesive categories introduced by Lack and Sobocinski. In this paper we show that most of the HLR properties, which had been introduced ad hoc to generalize some basic results from the category of graphs to high-level structures, are valid already in adhesive HLR categories. As a main new result in a categorical framework we show the Critical Pair Lemma for local confluence of transformations. Moreover we present a new version of embeddings and extensions for transformations in our framework of adhesive HLR systems.},

abstract="The concept of typed attributed graph transformation is most significant for modeling and meta modeling in software engineering and visual languages, but up to now there is no adequate theory for this important branch of graph transformation. In this paper we give a new formalization of typed attributed graphs, which allows node and edge attribution. The first main result shows that the corresponding category is isomorphic to the category of algebras over a specific kind of attributed graph structure signature. This allows to prove the second main result showing that the category of typed attributed graphs is an instance of ``adhesive HLR categories''. This new concept combines adhesive categories introduced by Lack and Soboci{\'{n}}ski with the well-known approach of high-level replacement (HLR) systems using a new simplified version of HLR conditions. As a consequence we obtain a rigorous approach to typed attributed graph transformation providing as fundamental results the Local Church-Rosser, Parallelism, Concurrency, Embedding and Extension Theorem and a Local Confluence Theorem known as Critical Pair Lemma in the literature.",

abstract="This article introduces the combined use of multi-formalism modelling and meta-modelling to facilitate computer assisted modelling of complex systems. The approach allows one to model different parts of a system using different formalisms. Models can be automatically converted between formalisms thanks to information found in a Formalism Transformation Graph (FTG), proposed by the authors. To aid in the automatic generation of multi-formalism modelling tools, formalisms are modelled in their own right (at a meta-level) within an appropriate formalism. This has been implemented in the interactive tool AToM3. This tool is used to describe formalisms commonly used in the simulation of dynamical systems, as well as to generate custom tools to process (create, edit, transform, simulate, optimise, ...) models expressed in the corresponding formalism. AToM3 relies on graph rewriting techniques and graph grammars to perform the transformations between formalisms as well as for other tasks, such as code generation and operational semantics specification.",
